THEORY 
Tableau allows users to connect to different data file formats (Excel, CSV, JSON, etc.) 
and create the first visualization by dragging fields onto rows/columns.
Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that helps to analyze, understand, and present data effectively.
The first visualization usually involves connecting a dataset and plotting a simple chart like a line or bar graph.
Tableau automatically identifies dimensions and measures to generate meaningful visuals.
The importance of Tableau lies in its ability to turn raw data into interactive insights quickly.
It is widely used in business intelligence, decision-making, and data analysis due to its simplicity and efficiency.
